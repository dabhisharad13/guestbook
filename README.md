# guestbook
In this project, I built and deployed a simple guestbook application. The application consists of a web front-end that takes a text input where you can enter any text and submit. I have also created Kubernetes Deployments and Pods. I have also applied Horizontal Pod Scaling to the Guestbook application and finally worked on Rolling Updates and Rollbacks.
